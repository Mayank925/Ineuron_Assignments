    "Ans: lists and strings are similar in that they are both sequences of values. They can both be indexed, sliced, and iterated over in similar ways, and they can both be combined using the + operator. Additionally, lists can be converted to strings using the str function, and strings can be converted to lists using the list function."

    "Ans: When a list is assigned to a variable, the variable holds a reference to the list, not the values contained in the list. This means that if you have multiple variables referencing the same list, changes made to the list through one variable will be reflected in all other variables that reference the same list.\n",

    "Ans: In general, copy.copy() is used when you want to create a new object that is a copy of an existing object, but you don't want to change the original object. copy.deepcopy() is used when you want to create a completely independent copy of an object, including all of its elements, and you don't want any changes made to the new object to affect the original object."
